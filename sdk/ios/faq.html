<p>The Twilio Client iOS library works with iOS 6 and higher, and has
been tested on iOS 6, 7 and 8.  </p>

<p>If you are using CocoaPods, please include the TwilioSDK 
PodSpec in your Podfile. CocoaPods sets up header and library files and includes necessary frameworks in your project.</p>

<p>If you do not use CocoaPods, please follow the steps below to setup your project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the static libraries (files ending in <code>.a</code>) in the
<code>Libraries/</code> folder to your project.</li>
  <li>Add the <code>Headers/</code> folder to "Header Search
Paths" in your target's Build Settings.</li>
  <li>Add the following iOS SDK frameworks to your project:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AudioToolbox.framework</strong> </li>
      <li><strong>AVFoundation.framework</strong> </li>
      <li><strong>CFNetwork.framework</strong> </li>
      <li><strong>SystemConfiguration.framework</strong>   </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add <code>-ObjC</code> to "Other Linker Flags" in your target's Build Settings. </li>
</ol>

<p>You will also need to configure "Audio and AirPlay" and "Voice over IP"
background flags for your application.  See <a href="#backgrounding">How do I Set up Backgrounding?</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Optionally, if you are using the sound resources provided by the Twilio 
Client library, add the contents of <code>Resources/</code> to the Resources of your project.</p>

<p>The Twilio Client package requires and includes
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> static libraries that you must add to
your project.  We currently ship pre-built versions of OpenSSL 1.0.1k
for you to use.  If you require a modified or newer version of OpenSSL
that you build yourself, you may substitute your own copies of
<code>libcrypto.a</code> and <code>libssl.a</code>.  However, using an older version
(especially from the obsolete 0.9.8 or 1.0.0 series) is unlikely to
work properly and is unsupported.</p>

<p>For convenience, the <code>libTwilioClient.a</code> library, as well as the 
OpenSSL libraries, are universal binaries containing code for the
following processor architectures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>i386 (for iOS Simulator)</li>
  <li>x86_64 (for iOS Simulator)</li>
  <li>armv7</li>
  <li>armv7s</li>
  <li>arm64</li>
</ul>

<p>iOS devices that use a processor that only supports the older armv6
architecture are <strong>not</strong> supported, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Original iPhone</li>
  <li>iPhone 3G</li>
  <li>iPod Touch 1st generation</li>
  <li>iPod Touch 2nd generation</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some older (but supported) devices, such as the iPhone 3GS
and iPod Touch 3rd generation, may struggle to perform well given the
CPU-intensive audio processing performed during calls.</p>

<h2 id="a-namethreadinghow-do-i-handle-multi-threadinga"><a name="threading">How do I Handle Multi-Threading?</a></h2>

<p>Much of the work in Twilio Client iOS SDK is performed in background
threads.  This includes callbacks to Twilio Client delegate objects.
You should ensure that you are on the main thread when performing any UI
updates in response to a Twilio Client delegate callback.</p>

<p>For example, if one of your objects implements the <code>TCConnectionDelegate</code>
protocol and you have a view which should update in response to the
<code>-(void)connectionDidDisconnect:(TCConnection*)connection</code> method, you
should write code similar to the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(void)connectionDidDisconnect:(TCConnection*)connection  
{
    // add code to update necessary model objects or other state  
    // ...  

    // finally, update the view's UI, being sure to do so on the main thread  
    [myView performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(syncUI:)  
                             withObject:param  
                          waitUntilDone:NO];  
}
</pre>

<p>The internal architecture of Twilio Client for iOS makes use of an
asynchronous queuing system to route the heavy lifting of API calls onto
a background thread managed by the library.  This helps ensure that API
calls made from the main thread will not cause UI stuttering, and it
also allows you to invoke the Twilio Client API from any thread in your
application.</p>

<h2 id="a-namebackgroundinghow-do-i-set-up-backgroundinga"><a name="backgrounding">How do I Set up Backgrounding?</a></h2>

<p>You want to ensure that the proper iOS flags (<code>audio</code>, <code>voip</code>) are
set for your application plist key "UIBackgroundModes" if your
application supports backgrounding.  Please, note that the <code>HelloMonkey-Info.plist</code>
file has the following entries in the Quickstart project:</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;key&gt;UIBackgroundModes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;audio&lt;/string&gt;  
    &lt;string&gt;voip&lt;/string&gt;  
&lt;/array&gt;
</pre>

<p>In Xcode 6, you can set this in your application target by navigating to
the "Capabilities" pane and under "Background Modes" and checking "Audio and
AirPlay" and "Voice over IP".</p>

<p>When <code>TCDevice</code> is initialized with incoming connection capability, 
the Twilio Client iOS SDK uses <code>setKeepAliveTimeout:handler:</code> to 
maintain its registration to Twilio's servers. You are therefore unable 
to use <code>setKeepAliveTimeout:handler:</code> in your application code as this 
would interfere with the SDK's background behavior.</p>

<p>For more information on backgrounding apps, including how to present
notifications for incoming calls when your app is in background, see
"Scheduling Local Notifications" in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction/Introduction.html">Local and Remote Notification
Programming Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-namesoundshow-do-i-configure-soundsa"><a name="sounds">How do I Configure Sounds?</a></h2>

<p>Twilio Client comes with optional audio files for various connection
events including an outgoing connection sound, an incoming connection
sound, a disconnected sound, and tones for the
<code>-[TCConnection sendDigits:(NSString*)digits]</code> API.</p>

<p>If these resources are included in your project (see <a href="#building">How do I Build an App?</a>), 
they will be automatically invoked by Twilio Client
library at appropriate times during a connection's life-cycle unless
you have overridden the relevant sound property on <code>TCDevice</code>.</p>

<p>If no other connections are pending or in-progress, the incoming
connection sound will be played in a loop through the device's primary
speaker as long as the Core Audio route description for output is either
the speaker or receiver (the built-in speaker you hold to your ear when
you make a call; not all iOS devices have a receiver), otherwise the
sound will be played through the current output audio route (e.g.
headphones, Bluetooth accessory, etc.).</p>

<p>Once a connection is in-progress, the first of any additional incoming
connections will trigger the sound once through the current output audio
route.</p>

<p>All other sounds will be played through the current output audio route.</p>

<p>For more information about audio routes, please see 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/Audio/Conceptual/AudioSessionProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html">Audio Session Programming Guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you need more advanced control over playback of sounds, you may
provide audio resources with alternate names (and/or disable the sounds
using the relevant properties on <code>TCDevice</code>) and manage playback using
your own classes.</p>
